Hello there! I am currently using GitHub to mess around with code, as well as make projects that are somewhat useful.

LeagueOfFreeWorlds/LeagueOfFreeWorlds is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
